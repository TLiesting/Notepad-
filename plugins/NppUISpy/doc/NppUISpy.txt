============
  Features
============

With this plugin you can explore the main menu structure and the toolbar of
Notepad++ to figure out which menu command ids are assigned to menu items and
toolbar buttons.

Menu items are displayed as a tree structure and toolbar buttons as a list. You
can left-click on both kind of items to execute the related command.

With a right click to the items a context menu pops up where you can select to
copy the item's icon, its text or its menu command id to the clipboard.

Both the menu item tree and the toolbar button list provide full-text search.
Start typing while one of them is focused to make the first matching item
getting highlighted.
